### ⚡ a.k.a. Electronicus | BROCCOLI | The Architect of OCTOPUS 🧠

I’m a **Computer Science & Engineering** student from India, walking the path from a **C beginner** to a **Full-Stack Developer, App Creator, and Future Tech Founder.**

I believe knowledge is power — and creation is revolution.  
From drawing art on paper to writing code that builds worlds — I’m shaping my vision step by step.

## 🧩 The Vision: PROJECT OCTOPUS 🐙

> “Some visions are not meant to be spoken — they are meant to be built.”  

There’s something I’m working toward — something that connects everything I learn, create, and imagine.  
For now, it stays behind the curtain.  

When the time comes — when the idea becomes real enough to change a small corner of the world —  
this space will reveal what it truly means.  

Until then, I’m learning, experimenting, and quietly constructing the foundation.

## 🧩 Fun Side

🎨 Artist | ⚙️ Maker | 💡 Inventor | 🎮 Dreamer

I grew up powered by imagination — cartoons like _Doraemon_ and universes like _Avengers_ didn’t just entertain me,  
they made me question everything: science, existence, and the limits of human creation.

While college lectures drown in routine and an education system that kills curiosity,  
these stories fuel my fire — they remind me why I started learning, building, and dreaming in the first place.
